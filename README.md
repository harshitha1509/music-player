# music-player
This code sets up a minimalistic audio player with custom controls for shuffle, play/pause, forward, backward, and a like button, along with a visual progress bar and time display for the song. The functionality will be handled via JavaScript (app.js), and the styling through a linked stylesheet (style.css).
This Project creates a simple music player interface that allows users to play, pause, and view the progress of an audio file. Here's a breakdown of its components
Play/Pause functionality: Toggling between play and pause using the play button.
Progress Bar Update: As the audio plays, the #progresschild element expands, visually representing the song's progress.
Time Update: The current time and total duration are updated dynamically during playback.
