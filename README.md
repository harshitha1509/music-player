# music-player
This code sets up a minimalistic audio player with custom controls for shuffle, play/pause, forward, backward, and a like button, along with a visual progress bar and time display for the song. The functionality will be handled via JavaScript (app.js), and the styling through a linked stylesheet (style.css).
